    "Thus, before we go any further, let's introduce these three fundamental Pandas data structures: the ``Series``, ``DataFrame``, and ``Index``.\n",

For instance, below, we want to create some wedding plans of people, and which side of the family they belong to.  Given a list of names (as the index), a list of family affiliations, and their ages below, we can create a dataframe as a dictionary of lists."
